# Fetch Frontend Take-Home Exercise

Welcome to the Fetch Frontend Take-Home Exercise! This project helps dog lovers search through a database of shelter dogs to find the perfect match for adoption.

## Overview

In this project, you will:

- Build a website that allows users to log in with their name and email.
- Fetch and display shelter dogs using an API.
- Enable users to filter dogs by breed and sort them alphabetically.
- Allow users to add dogs to a favorites list and generate a match based on their favorites.

### Key Features

- **Login Screen**: Collects the user's name and email.
- **Search Page**:
  - Filter dogs by breed.
  - Paginate results.
  - Sort dogs alphabetically by breed (ascending or descending).
  - Display all fields of the dog object (except for the ID).
  - Add dogs to a favorites list.
- **Match Generation**: Once dogs are added to favorites, a match will be generated based on the favorited dog IDs.
